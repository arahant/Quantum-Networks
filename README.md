# Quantum-Networks

Herein I explore some of the shortcomings of classical network in addressing critical security problems that plague the internet, and elaborate on the advantages of the quantum approach, thus presenting my case for the design and development of a **Quantum Network based on Multipartite entanglement**.

The evolution of the classical internet, although quite patchy, is extra-ordinary. It is the fastest penetrating infrastructure today, eclipsing electricity, telephone and gas. A majority of the communication happens over the internet, thereby fundamentally revolutionising the way we access information about this world.

However, there are many critical problems associated with classical internet, such as, Spam (SPIT), Security (DoS, TCP SYN flooding, Data breach attacks), and Remote voting (by mail or online), where classical network and communication protocols fall short. Quantum computing and its communication protocols are well suited to provide elegant solutions to these problems.

I’ve designed a quantum network framework and backed it with an elaborate implementation and simulation and used data analytics on the simulation data. I‘ve used **Qutech’s SimulaQron** for this purpose. It provides a fairly open and programmable framework to implement, which abstracts the nature of the underlying quantum communication technology.
