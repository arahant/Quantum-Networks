Proposal (Feb 21)
============

1 page describing the following:
* The Project title
* Team member names
(Teams of 2 are highly recommended. Doing the project solo is OK, but will be much more work.)
* One paragraph about what the research problem is.
* One paragraph about how you'll go about solving it (simulation, emulation, theoretical analysis, implementation etc.)
* One paragraph about what resources you'll need.
* One paragraph with the schedule and which team member will do what.

Checkpoint (Week following spring break: March 23 through 27)
============
* In-class presentation describing your work for about 15--20 minutes (depending on how many teams there are.)
* By this point, you should at least have one
  experimental/simulation/theoretical/implementation result that you can talk
  about. It's OK (even preferable) if the result is small.

Presentation (May 14)
============
* Poster presentation describing your completed work for about 15--20 minutes.

Paper (due May 16)
============
* A 6-page paper describing your results. Here is one example of how to write a
6-page paper (https://cs.nyu.edu/~anirudh/perf_query.pdf). It's not the only way,
and you have considerable latitude here so long as the paper is clearly written.
If you want me to look at a draft of the paper beforehand, I am happy to do that
and give you early feedback.
